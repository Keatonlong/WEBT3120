        <h1>From The Beginning</h1>
        <p>Historians trace the origins of graphic design to early cave paintings from about 38,000 BC. These early forms of cave paintings were how people communicated from one generation to another. 

            Subjects in these cave paintings mainly featured animals, handprints, weapons, and other references to hunting. While it is unclear what humans were communicating, it is obvious they were communicating visually.

        <h2>Frist HyroGlyths</h2>

        <p>The next evolution of graphic design is language itself and the visual representation with the alphabet. The Sumerians are credited for the invention of writing c. 3300 to 3000 BC. These early forms of writing were pictographs, symbols that represented objects. You can already start to see the early forms of graphic design at play.</p>

        <h1>History Of HyroGlyths</h1>
        <p>Cuneiform is a system of writing first developed by the ancient Sumerians of Mesopotamia c. 3500 BCE. It is considered the most significant among the many cultural contributions of the Sumerians and the greatest among those of the Sumerian city of Uruk, which advanced the writing of cuneiform c. 3200 BCE and allowed for the creation of literature.</p>

            <h3>Invention Of The Printing Press</h3>
            <p>Of course, we can not have graphic design without the invention of printing. As far back as 200 CE, China used woodblock printing to stamp designs on silk clothes and eventually on paper. In 1040, Bi Sheng invented the world is first movable type printing press out of porcelain.</p>
            <P>Johannes Gutenberg brought moveable type to Europe in 1439, introducing mass communication to Western culture. With the Gutenberg press, literature and literacy opened up to the masses, making it affordable and accessible. People no longer had to rely on lengthy scholarly reproductions of books. The Gutenberg press forged a path for more commercial uses of design, which led to the era of graphic design as we know it.</P>
