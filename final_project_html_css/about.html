<p>Now you have a better idea of how graphic design began with the earliest form of visual and written communication. Let’s dive into some key influential art movements that helped evolved graphic design as we know it. 

    You may notice how these art movements influence trends and how some of them even come back into style. It’s important to have a solid understanding of the history of design so you can understand where these trends come from and how to use them in your design.</p>

        <h1>Art Nouveau</h1>
        <p>Art Nouveau (“New Art”) flourished in western Europe and the United States from the 1880s until the First World War. It was a deliberate attempt to abandon the historical styles of the 19th century. 

            Creators of Art Nouveau sought to revive good workmanship, raise the status of craft, and produce a genuinely modern design that reflected the utility of the items they were creating. One distinctive characteristic of the style is the use of organic, asymmetrical linework instead of solid, uniform shapes applied across architecture, interiors, jewelry, as well as posters and illustration.</p>

        <p>From the 1880s until the First World War, western Europe and the United States witnessed the development of Art Nouveau (“New Art”). Taking inspiration from the unruly aspects of the natural world, Art Nouveau influenced art and architecture especially in the applied arts, graphic work, and illustration. </p>

<h2>Bauhaus</h2>
<p>Bauhaus was an influential art and design movement that began in 1919 in Weimar, Germany. The Bauhaus school, founded by Walter Gropius, launched a new way of thinking. 

    Six months after the end of World War I, the school encouraged artists and designers to use their talents to help rebuild the broken society. The Bauhaus grammar a triangle, a square, and a circle evoked this back-to-the-basics mentality. They challenged everything, including the usual method of schooling.
    
    They combined arts and crafts, classical and avant-garde styles, form and function. Bauhaus design incorporated minimalism, geometric shapes, and simple typography. While the Bauhaus bubble lasted for only 14 years, its influence remains in just about every aspect of modern life today.</p>

    <h3>Art Deco</h3>
    <p>Art Deco originated in Paris, where the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes gave it its name.

        Style, elegance, and sophistication are the epitome of Art Deco design. ARt Deco uses simple shapes, stylized and geometric ornamentation, and elaborate use of expensive materials, both natural and synthetic.
        
        Spanning architecture, furniture, fashion, sculpture, and more, Art Deco encapsulates the decadent spirit of the 1930s. The Rockefeller Centre, Chrysler Building, and Empire State Building were all designed in the style.

        <h3>Pop Art</h3>
        <p>Primarily a British and American cultural phenomenon that gained traction in the late 1950s and 1960s, Pop Art was named by art critic Lawrence Alloway because of the way it glorified popular culture and elevated commonplace, often unremarkable objects to iconic statuses.

            The pop art movement began as a revolt against the dominant approaches to art, culture, and traditional views on what art should be. Sources of inspiration ranged from Hollywood movies, advertising, product packaging, pop music, and comic books, rejecting the pretensions of “high art” in favor of bold, graphic printmaking.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>First, let is begin with defining what graphic design is. The term “graphic design” is broad and is often used to categorize various disciplines of design including digital and web design. But traditional graphic design is print design like posters, book covers, magazine layout, advertisements, package design, as well as logo and branding.

            Essentially, as a graphic designer, you take visual content like illustrations or photography and combine them with typography to communicate a message. The key is communication.</p>
