        <p>The shoes revival in the 2000s was a saving grace for a company that had already suffered through bankruptcy and was struggling to compete in the shadow of sportswear superbrands. So, how did the business turn the tide? It did what many other flailing labels were doing at the time: it went back to its roots.</p>

Shortly after 2001 saw a production of Dogtown and Z-Boys which was Stacy Peralta look at the beginnings of skateboarding and how it grew, the film won Audience and Best Director Award and the 2001 Sundance Film Festival.</p>

        <h3>Vans Gallery</h3>
        <p>Vans #36, the Old Skool, debuts with the now famous Vans Sidestripe. The Old Skool is Vans' first skate shoe that incorporated leather panels for increased durability. What started as a random doodle by Paul Van Doren was originally referred to as the "jazz stripe" and has become the unmistakable hallmark of the Vans brand.</p>
