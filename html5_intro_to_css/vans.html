        <p>The Sk8-Hi was introduced in 1978 as "Style 38," and showcased the now-iconic Vans Sidestripe on yet another innovative silhouette. As only the second model featuring the recognizable marker formerly known as the "jazz stripe," the Sk8-Hi took skate functionality to the next levelâabove the ankle, where skateboarders used and abused their lower extremities the most. The Sk8-Hi not only shielded bones from skateboards catapulted at them but also brought a whole new look to the park.</p>
