        <h3>Did you know?</h3>


        <p>The company was originally founded by brothers Paul and Jim Van Doren. They had two partners along with them, Gordon Lee and Serge Delia. Vans was founded on March 16, 1966, and opened at 704 E. Broadway in Anaheim California. The first day of opening, only 12 customers showed up. The first 12 customers were asked to return later in the day to pick up their shoes as a problem had arisen. They did but the brothers had not any change and then asked the 12 customers to return the next day to pay, and all 12 did. Their most celebrated shoe is the Vans #95, aka Era, which was designed by skateboarding legends Tony Alva and Stacy Peralta. In 1997 the Vans #36 debuted as the Old Skool and is considered the hallmark shoe of the entire brand.</p>
