        <h1>History of Vans Sneaker</h1>
        <p>Originating in 1966, the Van Doren Rubber Company, now known as Vans, was born from humble beginnings in Anaheim, Calif. Brothers Paul and James Van Doren were interested in providing footwear directly to California customers without wholesaling to retailers. Their East Broadway business captivated consumers and cut through the need of a middleman by producing shoes on the spot for those in need of footwear. It is said that on their first day of business, the brothers sold shoes from scratch to 12 customers who all had their pairs ready for pickup that same afternoon.</p>

        <p>Relying on simple construction, namely a canvas upper and waffle sole, the Van Doren brothers made waves early on by introducing the #44 Deck Shoe, a low profile silhouette that soon attracted the attention of local skateboarders. Through the 1960s and into the 1970s, the brand would expand their offerings of silhouettes, designing marquee models of various cuts and shapes. At the time, Vans offerings relied on numeric notation much like that early #44. By 1976, the minds of Tony Alva and Stacy Peralta had created an updated version of the #44. This pair was backed by a padded ankle collar and is now known as the Era. Quickly, Vans expanded its offerings through signature branding, namely the jazz stripe and Off the Wall logo.</p>

            <h2>All About Sneakers</h2>
            <p>Over the course of its rise, Vans was built with the support of skateboarders and local customers. The brands reliance on waffle soles and canvas construction catapulted the mission the Van Doren courageously set out on, providing loyal skaters with low profile comfort and sticky traction. Eventually, the Van Dorens venture was not just popping locally, it was also catching the attention of fans far removed from Anaheim.

                Soon enough, skateboarding became popular not just on the West Coast but across the country and around the world, expanding the reach of Vans and adding new layers to their business model. Skaters such as Steve Caballero were making Vans their own, literally and figuratively, while the brand was also gaining steam in similar extreme sports including BMX and snowboarding.</p>
