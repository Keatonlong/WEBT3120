        <p>Over the course of its rise, Vans was built with the support of skateboarders and local customers. The brand reliance on waffle soles and canvas construction catapulted the mission the Van Doren courageously set out on, providing loyal skaters with low profile comfort and sticky traction. Eventually, the Van Dorens venture was not just popping locally, it was also catching the attention of fans far removed from Anaheim.</p>

        <p>The shoes revival in the 2000s was a saving grace for a company that had already suffered through bankruptcy and was struggling to compete in the shadow of sportswear superbrands.

        <h3>Vans Gallery</h3>
        <p>Vans #36, the Old Skool, debuts with the now famous Vans Sidestripe. The Old Skool is Vans' first skate shoe that incorporated leather panels for increased durability. What started as a random doodle by Paul Van Doren was originally referred to as the "jazz stripe" and has become the unmistakable hallmark of the Vans brand.</p>
